# ToDo App w/Firebase.

This is a todo list app utilizing Firebase authentication and database services.

Users can create an account and login to view/edit their todos from any device.

Some other features I added were:

--Filter Todos based on completion status and priority.
--Forgot password feature that sends a password reset link to the users email address.
--Users can either sign in with their Google account or any other email address of their choosing.
